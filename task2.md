## TASK 2:

### Question 1:

Using the Java programming language, a program was written to respond to the pythong line, "it's only a bunny...". The following block provides the code. Upon execution the text contained in the **printScreen()** method is written to the console.


```java
public class task1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printScreen();
    }

    public static void printScreen(){
        System.out.println("That's no ordinary rabbit. That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.");
    }
}
```

### Question 2:

A page with links to all homework assignments was created [here](homework_assigments.md). A software manual was created [here](). 

### Question 3:

### Question 4:

A program was written with Java to approximate the derivative of the function f '' (x) = -cos(x) using the central 
difference approximation (CDA) method. The code is given [here](code/task2/approximator.java).



The values shown in the following table include the value of h,
the true value of f '' (2), CDA of f '' (x) at x = 2 + h, and the difference
between the approximate and true value (error). 

```
                   h                Value         Approximate value                Error
                (Î”X)               f''(2)                     (CDA)       (CDA - cos(2))

The error tends to decrease with the value of h until h = .00001, at which point the error sharply increases. 
Using Python, a plot of the logged h value vs the logged error was acquired.

The slope of the error decrease was measured using the linregress method from the scipy.stats method (the code is available [here](code/task2/plot.py)). The decreasing portion of the line had a slope of 1.997, or about 2. Because the slope of the line is arbitrarily close to 2, we confirm that this is a second order approximation.
