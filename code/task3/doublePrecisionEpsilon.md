# Double Precision Epsilon:

**Routine Name:** doublePrecisionEpsilon

**Author:** Hyrum Hansen

**Language:** Java

**Description:** This routine will compute the double precision value for the machine epsilon. This is done by examining the number of digits in the representation of a real number.
The method takes no arguments and returns void; however, it prints 25 lines to the console which implies that it takes 25 iterations to reach a value which is considered to be zero
in terms of single precision accuracy.
