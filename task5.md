## TASK 5:

### Question 1:

Newton's method was implemented to approximate the root of the function given in tasksheet 4. Newton's method 
approximated roots much faster than did functional iteration or the bisection method. With a tolerance of 0.0001,
Newton's method found a root in just five steps. Implementation details may be found [here](). See below for example output.

```java
 Error 1: 0.097947
 Error 2: 0.066814
 Error 3: 0.026410
 Error 4: 0.003399
 Error 5: 0.000050

Root: -0.805380
```
