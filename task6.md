## TASK 6:

### Question 1:

A Java program was written which implemented four methods to approximate the root nearest to zero for the given function. The program may be found [here](https://github.com/HyrumHansen/math4610/blob/main/code/task6/FourMethods.md). Given below is the program's output:

```java
** Bisection Method **
	It took 13 iterations to approximate this root with the bisection method.
	Approximate Root: 0.483612

** Fixed Point Iteration Method **
	It took 30 iterations to approximate this root with fixed point iteration.
	Approximate Root: 0.482302

** Secant Method **
	It took 5 iterations to approximate this root with the secant method.
	Approximate Root: 0.483611

** Newton's Method **
	It took 4 iterations to approximate this root with newton's method.
	Approximate Root: 0.483611
```
